                    indirect, punitive, special, incidental, or consequential
                    damage, however it arises (including attorneys’ fees and all
                    related costs and expenses of litigation and arbitration, or
                    at trial or on appeal, if any, whether or not litigation or
                    arbitration is instituted), whether in an action of

                    consequential damages, so the prior limitation or exclusion
                    may not apply to you.
